			<li>Personal background: Born in San Diego, moved to Morganton NC where I grew up in that small town.Then relocated to Charlotte after I got out of the Marine Corps. </li>
            <li>Professional:  I went in to the Marines after high school, I got out and then floated around for 2 years. After that I got a job at a helpdesk. From there I was able to get a job on campus with OneIT and work on all the networking for the campus.</li>
            <li>Academic background: Military training, Network Admin, Software Dev</li>
			<li>Information/Technology background: I messed with various radios and switches in the military. Also on campus I am exposed to more Cisco equipment.</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I had some experience messing with HTML in my software engineering class.</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows </li>
            <li>Courses I'm taking and reason for each: 
                <ul> 
					<li>ITSC 2600: Honestly needed that 1 credit class to graduate.  </li>
					<li>ITIS 3130: This class was the only availble elective computer science class that I could have registered for :(					</li>
					<li>ITIS 3135: Needed this class for my major. The professor and TA are pretty chill.</li>
					<li>ITIS 4260: Another class needed for my major honestly its alright 3/5 yelp review. </li>
					<li>LBST 2212: Why we have to do Gen Ed classes again? That question will has yet to be answered. But this class is about comics and I like comics.</li>
				</ul>
				
            <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by: I went to Spain recently and we decided to go to a beach on a moped and we passed a gas station without paying attention to the gas meter. When I looked at the gas meter I told my girlfriend that we will get gas in the town that beach is at. We get to the town and there was no gas station :{. From there we ask a local where the closet gas station is at they said "oh not for another 10 miles".
			We were close to empty. So we made the decision to make the 10 mile trip. About half way to the gas station the moped read that we were empty on gas. We prayed that we didn't get stuck in the country side with no one around. Luckily we made it to the gas station.
                </li>
            <li>I'd also like to share: I enjoy playing tennis and currently watching the U.S. Open.
                </li>
